# David Leboss — Sticker Pack for iMessages (iOS 10)
<strong>David Leboss</strong> is a series of stickers designed for the iMessages platform on iOS, featuring the French alter ego of my cool boss David Siegel. If you want, you can check out his pretty ~~butt~~ face on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dvdsgl).

## Design
All the stickers, app icons, settings icons, and screenshots can be found [here](/design/assets/).<br />
There's also a [.sketch file](/design/sketch/David Leboss (Sticker Pack).sketch) that contains all the assets ready to be exported.<br />
The font used on the screenshots and other images is [Trash Hand](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/trashhand) by Luce Avérous.


## App Store
The stickers pack is already available on the App Store to [download](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/david-leboss/id1209749092).
